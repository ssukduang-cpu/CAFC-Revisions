Below is a breakdown of each:\n\n---\n\n### **Patent Eligibility under Alice/35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101**\nThe Alice/Mayo framework provides a two-step test to determine whether a claim is directed to patent-eligible subject matter:\n\n1. **Step One: Determine if the claims are directed to a patent-ineligible concept.**\n   - The court must determine whether the claims are directed to one of the three judicial exceptions to patent eligibility: **laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas**.\n   - If the claims are not directed to a patent-ineligible concept, they are patent-eligible under \u00a7 101.\n\n   **Supporting Excerpts:**\n   - \"[T]he first step of the Alice test requires a court to determine whether the claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept, such as an abstract idea.\" [Q125]\n   - \"The claims are considered in their entirety to ascertain whether their character as a whole is directed to excluded subject matter.\" [Q218]\n\n2. **Step Two: Search for an 'inventive concept.'**\n   - If the claims are directed to a patent-ineligible concept, the court examines whether the claims include an **inventive concept**\u2014i.e., an element or combination of elements that transforms the claim into a patent-eligible application.\n   - The inventive concept must do more than recite \"well-understood, routine, conventional activity.\" [Q126]\n\n   **Supporting Excerpts:**\n   - \"A claim that recites an abstract idea must include 'additional features' to ensure 'that the [claim] is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the [abstract idea].'\" [Q173]\n   - \"Simply appending routine, conventional steps to a natural phenomenon, specified at a high level of generality, is not enough to supply an inventive concept.\" [Q184]\n\n---\n\n### **Written Description Requirement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(a)**\nThe written description requirement ensures that the inventor had possession of the claimed invention as of the filing date and adequately described it in the specification.\n\n1. **Sufficient Disclosure:**\n   - The specification must \"reasonably convey[] to those skilled in the art that the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter as of the filing date.\" [Q24]\n\n2. **Enablement:**\n   - The specification must enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the claimed invention without undue experimentation. This is distinct from the written description requirement but is also part of \u00a7 112(a).\n\n3. **Definiteness:**\n   - The claims must particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter regarded as the invention.\n\n   **Supporting Excerpts:**\n   - \"To satisfy the written description requirement the patent disclosure must 'reasonably convey[] to those skilled in the art that the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter as of the filing date.'\" [Q24]\n   - \"The written description makes clear that the mathematical steps performed, and the types of data received, as claimed, are conventional and well understood in the prior art.\" [Q93]\n\n---\n\n### **Key Distinctions Between \u00a7 101 and \u00a7 112(a):**\n- **\u00a7 101 (Alice):** Focuses on whether the claimed subject matter is eligible for patent protection (e.g., not an abstract idea, law of nature, or natural phenomenon).\n- **\u00a7 112(a):** Focuses on whether the patent specification adequately describes and enables the claimed invention, ensuring the inventor had possession of the invention and disclosed it sufficiently.\n\n---\n\n### CITATION_MAP:\n[Q24] Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. v.

          "raw_response": "## Immediate Answer:\nObviousness analysis under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 focuses on whether the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of invention, based on prior art. In contrast, the written description requirement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 ensures that the patent specification demonstrates that the inventor was in possession of the claimed invention at the time of filing, including sufficient disclosure of the genus and its species.\n\n## Detailed Analysis:\n\n### Obviousness Analysis (\u00a7 103)\nObviousness analysis evaluates whether the claimed invention, including genus claims, would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the prior art. The analysis involves determining:\n1. The scope and content of the prior art.\n2. The differences between the prior art and the claims at issue.\n3. The level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.\n4. Secondary considerations, such as commercial success or long-felt but unsolved needs, if relevant. [Q67], [Q68], [Q126].\n\nFor genus claims, obviousness focuses on whether the prior art teaches or suggests the genus as a whole or provides motivation to combine prior art references to arrive at the claimed genus. For example, in *KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc.*, the Court emphasized that obviousness is determined by whether there is a reason to combine prior art teachings to achieve the claimed invention. [Q63], [Q69].\n\n### Written Description Requirement (\u00a7 112)\nThe written description requirement ensures that the patent specification adequately discloses the claimed invention, demonstrating that the inventor was in possession of the invention at the time of filing. For genus claims, this requires:\n1. A description of a representative number of species within the genus, or\n2. Disclosure of structural features common to the genus that allow a person skilled in the art to recognize the claimed genus. [Q186], [Q193].\n\nThe written description requirement is distinct from enablement and focuses on whether the specification provides sufficient detail to show that the inventor actually invented the claimed genus. For example, in *Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Co.*, the court held that a genus claim must be supported by a description of either representative species or common structural features that allow skilled artisans to visualize or recognize the claimed genus. [Q186], [Q193].\n\n### Key Differences\n1. **Purpose**:\n   - Obviousness (\u00a7 103): Prevents granting patents for inventions that lack sufficient inventive step over prior art.\n   - Written Description (\u00a7 112): Ensures the inventor actually possessed the claimed invention and disclosed it adequately.\n\n2. **Focus**:\n   - Obviousness: Examines the relationship between the claimed invention and prior art.\n   - Written Description: Examines the sufficiency of the disclosure in the patent specification.\n\n3. **Timing**:\n   - Obviousness: Evaluated as of the time the invention was made.\n   - Written Description: Evaluated as of the filing date of the patent application.\n\n4. **Standard**:\n   - Obviousness: Based on whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would find the invention obvious.\n   - Written Description: Based on whether the specification demonstrates possession of the claimed invention.\n\n5. **Genus Claims**:\n   - Obviousness: Focuses on whether the prior art teaches or suggests the genus as a whole or provides motivation to combine references to achieve the genus.\n   - Written Description: Requires disclosure of representative species or common structural features to show possession of the genus. [Q186], [Q193].\n\n### Illustrative Case Law\n- In *Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Co.*, the court emphasized that a genus claim must be supported by sufficient disclosure of representative species or common structural features. [Q186], [Q193].\n- In *KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc.*, the Court highlighted that obviousness involves determining whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine prior art references to achieve the claimed invention. [Q63], [Q69].\n\n## Practitioner Guidance\n1. **For Obviousness**: Focus on identifying prior art that teaches or suggests the claimed genus or provides motivation to combine references to achieve the genus.\n2. **For Written Description**: Ensure the specification includes sufficient disclosure of representative species or common structural features to demonstrate possession of the claimed genus.\n3. **Pitfalls**: Avoid conflating the two standards. Obviousness is about the relationship to prior art, while written description is about the sufficiency of the disclosure in the specification.\n\n## CITATION_MAP:\n[Q63] *KSR International Co. v.

This standard is stricter than the previous \"reasonable examiner\" standard and focuses on whether the withheld information would have blocked the issuance of the patent under the PTO's evidentiary standards.\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n1. **Definition of But-For Materiality**: The Federal Circuit in *Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co.* held that \"the materiality required to establish inequitable conduct is but-for materiality.\" Specifically, \"undisclosed prior art is 'but-for material if the PTO would not have allowed a claim had it been aware of' it\" [1]. This requires courts to assess whether the PTO would have issued the patent if the withheld information had been disclosed.\n\n2. **Evidentiary Standards**: To determine materiality, the court must apply the preponderance of the evidence standard and give claims their broadest reasonable construction, as used during PTO examination [1], [2].\n\n3. **Exceptions for Egregious Misconduct**: The court also recognized an exception for \"affirmative acts of egregious misconduct,\" such as the filing of an unmistakably false affidavit, which can render the misconduct material even if it does not meet the but-for standard [3].\n\n4. **Application to Patent Prosecution**: Even if a district court does not invalidate a claim based on a deliberately withheld reference, the reference may still be material if it would have blocked patent issuance under the PTO's standards [2].\n\n## Practitioner Guidance\n- **Disclosure Obligations**: Patent applicants must disclose all information that could meet the but-for materiality standard to avoid allegations of inequitable conduct.\n- **Egregious Misconduct**: Avoid any affirmative misrepresentations or false statements to the PTO, as these may independently satisfy the materiality requirement.\n- **Litigation Strategy**: When asserting inequitable conduct, focus on proving that the withheld information would have prevented the PTO from granting the patent under its evidentiary standards.\n\nCITATION_MAP:\n[1] *American Calcar, Inc. v.

          "raw_response": "The doctrine of equivalents allows a patentee to claim insubstantial alterations to a patented invention that were not literally captured in the patent claims. However, prosecution history estoppel limits the application of the doctrine of equivalents when a patentee has narrowed the scope of claims during prosecution for reasons related to patentability. The Supreme Court's decision in *Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co.*, 535 U.S. 722 (2002), clarified the interplay between these doctrines.\n\nAfter *Festo*, prosecution history estoppel applies when a patentee makes a narrowing amendment to a claim for a substantial reason related to patentability. This creates a presumption that the patentee has surrendered all equivalents within the territory between the original claim and the amended claim. However, the presumption is not absolute and can be rebutted if the patentee demonstrates one of three exceptions:\n\n1. **Unforeseeability**: The alleged equivalent was unforeseeable at the time of the amendment.\n2. **Tangential Relation**: The rationale underlying the amendment bears no more than a tangential relation to the equivalent in question.\n3. **Some Other Reason**: There is some other reason suggesting that the patentee could not reasonably have been expected to describe the alleged equivalent.\n\nThe Federal Circuit has further refined the application of these principles in subsequent cases, emphasizing that the patentee bears the burden of proving that one of the exceptions applies. The inquiry into whether an exception applies is a question of law, and courts must base their analysis on the prosecution history record.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n1. **Prosecution History Estoppel as a Legal Limitation**:\n   Prosecution history estoppel is a legal limitation on the doctrine of equivalents. It prevents a patentee from recapturing, through the doctrine of equivalents, subject matter that was surrendered during prosecution to obtain the patent. As stated in *Festo*, \"A patentee\u2019s decision to narrow his claims through amendment may be presumed to be a general disclaimer of the territory between the original claim and the amended claim.\" [Q16], [Q108].\n\n2. **Rebutting the Presumption**:\n   The patentee may rebut the presumption of surrender by demonstrating one of the three exceptions. For example:\n   - The Federal Circuit has held that the \"tangential relation\" exception focuses on the patentee's \"objectively apparent reason for the narrowing amendment.\" The reason must be discernible from the prosecution history record. [Q144], [Q125].\n   - The \"unforeseeability\" exception requires showing that the alleged equivalent was not reasonably foreseeable to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the amendment. [Q172], [Q170].\n\n3. **Case-Specific Applications**:\n   - In *Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira, Inc.*, the court held that the patentee successfully demonstrated that the rationale for its amendment was tangential to the accused equivalent, as the amendment was made to distinguish the invention from prior art and not to surrender functionally identical equivalents. [Q121], [Q128].\n   - In *Honeywell International Inc. v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp.*, the court emphasized that foreseeability must be directed to the particular equivalent in question and rejected the application of prosecution history estoppel where the equivalent was developed a decade after the patent application. [Q172], [Q170].\n\n4. **Public Notice Function**:\n   The doctrine of prosecution history estoppel serves the public notice function of patents by ensuring that the scope of surrendered subject matter is clear. This prevents patentees from unfairly expanding the scope of their claims through the doctrine of equivalents. [Q154], [Q158].\n\n### Practitioner Guidance\n\n1. **Careful Claim Drafting**: Patent prosecutors should draft claims with foresight to avoid unnecessary narrowing amendments that could trigger prosecution history estoppel.\n2. **Documenting Reasons for Amendments**: When making amendments, clearly document the rationale in the prosecution history to preserve the ability to argue that the amendment was tangential or unrelated to the equivalent in question.\n3. **Litigation Strategy**: In litigation, focus on the prosecution history record to argue whether the presumption of estoppel applies and whether any exceptions can be established.\n\n### CITATION_MAP:\n[Q16] *Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co.* (a8ad3fec-56df-4ab4-9781-3e975e71f0a1) | Page 16 | \"be a surrender of all equivalents within 'the territory between the original claim and the amended claim,' but the presumption is overcome if the patentee can show the applicability of one of the few exceptions identified by the Supreme Court.\"\n[Q108] *Regents of the U. of California v. Dakocytomation California* (81a0d977-2d4a-450f-922a-e1c256dd84f1) | Page 29 | \"A narrowing amendment is all that is required for the presumption of prosecution history estoppel to attach to bar the application of the doctrine of equivalents.\"\n[Q144] *Insituform Technologies, Inc. v. CAT Contracting, Inc.* (baf48d03-0dc7-4f5e-a166-9ea2b124be42) | Page 21 | \"Accordingly, we turn directly to the issue of whether the rationale behind the narrowing amendment was merely tangential (i.e., peripheral, or not directly relevant) to the alleged equivalent.\"\n[Q125] *Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira, Inc.* (a8ad3fec-56df-4ab4-9781-3e975e71f0a1) | Page 21 | \"Instead, we reaffirm that whether an amendment was merely tangential to an equivalent must be decided in the context of the invention disclosed in the patent and the prosecution history.\"\n[Q172] *Honeywell International Inc. v.

Analyze whether the specific equivalent in question falls within the scope of the surrendered subject matter.\n2. Assess whether any of the three exceptions to prosecution history estoppel apply based on the prosecution history record.\n3. Develop arguments for or against the application of prosecution history estoppel, focusing on the foreseeability and tangentiality exceptions.",

Citrix test for determining whether a claim term invokes means-plus-function treatment under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 (now \u00a7 112(f)) is as follows:\n\n1. **Presumption Based on the Use of \"Means\"**: If a claim term uses the word \"means,\" there is a rebuttable presumption that \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 applies. Conversely, if the term does not use the word \"means,\" there is a rebuttable presumption that \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 does not apply. [Q39], [Q71]\n\n2. **Rebutting the Presumption**: The presumption against applying \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 to a claim term that does not use \"means\" can be overcome if the challenger demonstrates that the claim term:\n   - Fails to \"recite sufficiently definite structure,\" or\n   - Recites \"function without reciting sufficient structure for performing that function.\" [Q37], [Q73]\n\n3. **Essential Inquiry**: The \"essential inquiry\" is whether the words of the claim are understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art to have a \"sufficiently definite meaning as the name for structure.\" [Q34], [Q117]\n\n4. **Sufficient Structure**: A claim term is deemed to recite sufficient structure if it is used in common parlance or by persons of skill in the pertinent art to designate structure, even if the term covers a broad class of structures or identifies the structures by their function. [Q115]\n\n5. **Claim Language and Specification**: The determination of whether a claim term invokes \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 is based on the claim language itself, read in light of the specification. The specification must describe the structure, materials, or acts that correspond to the claimed function. [Q35], [Q73], [Q119]\n\nCITATION_MAP:\n[Q34] Williamson v.

          "raw_response": "The correct framework for evaluating the motivation to combine references is provided by **Graham v. John Deere Co.**, as clarified and expanded upon by **KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc.**. Both cases are foundational, but KSR refined the application of the Graham framework, particularly with respect to flexibility and avoiding rigid rules.\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n1. **Graham Framework**:\n   Graham established the foundational framework for determining obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. It requires courts to consider:\n   - The scope and content of the prior art,\n   - The differences between the prior art and the claims at issue,\n   - The level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art, and\n   - Secondary considerations, such as commercial success, long-felt but unsolved needs, and failure of others, as indicia of nonobviousness. [Q202], [Q203], [Q278].\n\n   Graham emphasized that the ultimate question of obviousness is a legal determination based on these factual inquiries. [Q202].\n\n2. **KSR Refinement**:\n   KSR clarified that the Graham framework remains the correct approach but criticized rigid applications of the \"teaching, suggestion, or motivation\" (TSM) test. The Supreme Court in KSR emphasized that the obviousness inquiry must be \"expansive and flexible\" and that courts must avoid rigid rules that limit the inquiry. [Q206], [Q219].\n\n   Specifically, KSR stated:\n   - A motivation to combine references can arise from \"design incentives and other market forces\" or \"common sense.\" [Q207], [Q206].\n   - A combination of known elements may be obvious if it yields predictable results. [Q88].\n   - The TSM test, while useful, should not be applied as a rigid or mandatory formula. [Q90], [Q218].\n\n3. **Interplay Between Graham and KSR**:\n   KSR did not replace Graham but rather reinforced its principles while rejecting overly rigid applications of the TSM test. The Court in KSR explicitly stated that Graham \"set forth an expansive and flexible approach\" to the obviousness inquiry. [Q219].\n\n4. **Application in Subsequent Cases**:\n   - In **Virtek Vision International Ulc v. Assembly Guidance Systems, Inc.**, the Federal Circuit reiterated that obviousness requires not only that a skilled artisan could have combined references but also that they would have been motivated to do so. [Q280], [Q283].\n   - In **LKQ Corporation v. GM Global Technology Operations LLC**, the Federal Circuit noted that the Rosen-Durling test for design patents was inconsistent with the flexible approach mandated by KSR and Graham. [Q209], [Q219].\n\n## Practitioner Guidance\n\n- **Graham remains the foundation**: Always begin with the Graham factors when analyzing obviousness.\n- **KSR's flexibility**: Avoid rigid rules like requiring explicit teaching, suggestion, or motivation in the prior art. Instead, consider broader factors like design incentives, market pressures, and common sense.\n- **Evidence of motivation**: Ensure there is evidence or reasoning to support why a skilled artisan would combine references, not just that they could. Conclusory statements or mere knowledge of prior art elements are insufficient. [Q283], [Q285].\n\n## CITATION_MAP:\n[Q202] Graham v. John Deere Co.

John Deere Co.

(4c82cca6-d846-40f9-9a5f-35042df9ab96) | Page 12 | \"The Court explained that while the TSM test might provide helpful insight on the obviousness of an invention, such insights 'need not become rigid and mandatory.'\"\n[Q218] LKQ Corporation v.

Assembly Guidance Systems, Inc. (e1c0c138-43bf-4424-92df-c7ae00c651ae) | Page 4 | \"Obviousness is a question of law based on underlying facts.\"\n\n## Suggested Next Steps\n1. Analyze how courts have applied the Graham factors post-KSR to identify trends in motivation-to-combine reasoning.\n2. Investigate how courts distinguish between \"could have combined\" and \"would have combined\" in recent Federal Circuit cases.\n3. Explore the role of secondary considerations in overcoming a prima facie case of obviousness under the Graham framework.",

See \nPrometheus, 132 S. Ct. at 1303-04.  District courts have \ngreat discretion to control the conduct of proceedings \nbefore them, including the order of presentation of issues \nand evidence and the sequence of events proscribed by the \nFederal Rules and leading up to judgment.   See, e.g., \nAmado v. Microsoft Corp., 517 F.3d 1353, 1358 (Fed. Cir. \n2008) (\u201cDistrict courts . . . are afforded broad discretion to \ncontrol and manage their dockets, including the authority \nto decide the order in which they hear and decide issues \npending before them.\u201d).  Although \u00a7 101 has been \ncharacterized as a \u201cthreshold test,\u201d Bilski II, 130 S. Ct. at \n3225, and certainly can be addressed before other matters \ntouching the validity of patents, it need not always be \naddressed first, particularly when other sections might be \ndiscerned by the trial judge as having the promise to \nresolve a dispute more expeditiously or with more clarity \nand predictability.  See MySpace, Inc. v. GraphOn Corp., \n672 F.3d 1250, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2012).  Thus, consistent \nwith its role as the master of its own docket, a district \ncourt properly acts within its discretion in deciding when \nto address the diverse statutory challenges to validity.   \nHere, the district court exercised its discretion to \nentertain a challenge to the validity of the patents in suit \nunder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.  The district court\u2019s decision \nultimately turned on, and thus this appeal is primarily \ndirected to, the issue of whether the claimed inventions \nfall within the \u201cabstract ideas\u201d exception to patent \neligibility.  While the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in \nPrometheus reiterated the trilogy of \u201cimplicit\u201d exceptions \nto patent eligibility, including the exception for abstract \nideas, it did not directly address how to determine ",

But where, as \nhere, the bulk of the claim provides an abstract idea, and \nthe remaining limitations provide only necessary anteced-\nent and subsequent components, the claim\u2019s character as a \nwhole is directed to that abstract idea.

          "raw_response": "The amount of experimentation that is considered \"undue\" under the Wands factors for biological claims depends on a case-specific analysis of multiple factual considerations. The Federal Circuit has consistently emphasized that whether experimentation is undue is not a single, simple factual determination but rather a conclusion reached by weighing many factual considerations. These considerations, known as the Wands factors, include:\n\n1. **The quantity of experimentation necessary**  \n2. **The amount of direction or guidance presented in the specification**  \n3. **The presence or absence of working examples**  \n4. **The nature of the invention**  \n5. **The state of the prior art**  \n6. **The relative skill of those in the art**  \n7. **The predictability or unpredictability of the art**  \n8. **The breadth of the claims**  \n\nThe Federal Circuit has applied these factors in various cases involving biological claims, and the determination of undue experimentation often hinges on the interplay of these factors. Below are some key principles derived from the provided excerpts:\n\n1. **Breadth of Claims and Guidance in the Specification**: Claims that are broad in scope and require significant experimentation to identify functional embodiments are more likely to be found non-enabled. For example, in *Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.*, the court found that the specification failed to teach which combinations of labeled polynucleotides would exhibit the required functionality, rendering the claims invalid for lack of enablement. The court emphasized that the specification must provide sufficient guidance to enable the full scope of the claims without undue experimentation. [Q149], [Q152].\n\n2. **Unpredictability of the Art**: In fields like antibody development or molecular biology, where the art is highly unpredictable, the court has required more detailed guidance in the specification. For instance, in *Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi*, the court noted that the claims covered a vast scope of antibodies defined by their function, and the specification did not provide sufficient guidance to enable a skilled artisan to practice the full scope of the claims without undue experimentation. [Q172], [Q173].\n\n3. **Quantity of Experimentation**: The court has found undue experimentation where the number of potential candidates within the scope of the claims is vast, and the specification lacks sufficient guidance to narrow down the possibilities. For example, in *Idenix Pharmaceuticals LLC v. Gilead Sciences Inc.*, the court held that synthesizing and screening billions of possible compounds to identify functional embodiments constituted undue experimentation. [Q147].\n\n4. **Presence or Absence of Working Examples**: The presence of specific working examples in the specification can weigh against a finding of undue experimentation. Conversely, the absence of such examples, particularly in unpredictable fields, can support a finding of non-enablement. [Q161].\n\n5. **State of the Prior Art and Skill in the Art**: The court considers whether the prior art and the skill level of those in the field would allow a skilled artisan to practice the invention without undue experimentation. For example, in *Wands*, the court found that the specification adequately taught using hybridoma technology to produce the claimed antibodies, and the experimentation required was not undue. [Q174].\n\nIn summary, experimentation is considered undue when it requires excessive trial and error, lacks sufficient guidance in the specification, or involves an unpredictable field where the claims are broad and the specification fails to provide adequate direction. Each case requires a fact-specific analysis under the Wands factors.\n\nCITATION_MAP:\n[Q149] Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.

          "raw_response": "Courts apply the full scope of enablement requirement to genus claims by assessing whether the patent's specification enables a person of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the full scope of the claimed genus without undue experimentation. This analysis often involves the application of the *Wands* factors, which provide a framework for determining whether the experimentation required to practice the full scope of the claims is \"undue.\" These factors include the quantity of experimentation necessary, the amount of guidance provided in the specification, the presence or absence of working examples, the predictability or unpredictability of the art, and the breadth of the claims, among others.\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n1. **Breadth of the Claims**: Courts consider the breadth of the genus claims, particularly when the claims encompass a large number of species. For example, in *Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi*, the court noted that the claims covered \"millions of candidates\" and required the generation and screening of each candidate to determine whether it met the claimed functional limitations. The court emphasized that the broader the claims, the higher the burden on the patentee to enable the full scope of the genus. [1], [2]\n\n2. **Guidance and Working Examples**: Courts evaluate whether the patent provides sufficient guidance or working examples to enable a skilled artisan to practice the full scope of the claimed genus. In *Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi*, the court found that the specification disclosed only a small subset of examples and did not provide adequate guidance for the broader genus, requiring undue experimentation to identify functional embodiments. [3], [4]\n\n3. **Unpredictability of the Art**: The court considers whether the field of invention is predictable or unpredictable. In *Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi*, the court emphasized that antibody science is highly unpredictable, where even minor changes in structure can significantly alter functionality. This unpredictability heightened the enablement burden for the patentee. [5], [6]\n\n4. **Trial-and-Error Discovery**: Courts scrutinize whether the patent effectively requires a skilled artisan to engage in trial-and-error discovery to identify embodiments within the genus. In *Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi*, the court held that the specification's reliance on trial-and-error methods to identify functional antibodies rendered the claims non-enabled. [7], [8]\n\n5. **Comparison to Precedent**: Courts often compare the facts of the case to prior decisions. For example, in *Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi*, the court analogized the case to *Wyeth & Cordis Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories* and *Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.*, where claims were invalidated for lack of enablement due to the undue experimentation required to practice the full scope of the claims. [9], [10]\n\n## Practitioner Guidance\n\nTo satisfy the full scope of enablement requirement for genus claims:\n- Provide detailed guidance and working examples that cover a representative number of species within the genus.\n- Avoid relying solely on functional claim language without disclosing structural features or a clear correlation between structure and function.\n- Address the unpredictability of the art by providing sufficient disclosure to guide skilled artisans in practicing the full scope of the claims.\n- Minimize the need for trial-and-error experimentation by including specific methodologies or criteria for identifying functional embodiments.\n\n## CITATION_MAP:\n[1] *Amgen Inc. v.

          "raw_response": "## Immediate Answer:\nEvidence that rebuts a prima facie case of obviousness for combining prior art references includes objective indicia of nonobviousness, such as unexpected results, commercial success, long-felt but unmet needs, failure of others, and evidence that the prior art teaches away from the claimed invention. Additionally, evidence showing that the prior art does not enable the claimed invention or that there was no reasonable expectation of success in combining the references can also rebut a prima facie case.\n\n## Detailed Analysis:\n1. **Objective Indicia of Nonobviousness**:\n   - Evidence of unexpected results can rebut a prima facie case of obviousness. For example, \"evidence of unexpected results will rebut a prima facie case of obviousness\" [1].\n   - Commercial success, when tied to the claimed invention, is another factor. For instance, \"Transocean presented sufficient evidence of both commercial success and nexus to the features of the claimed invention\" [2].\n   - Long-felt but unmet needs and failure of others are also considered. \"Objective evidence of nonobviousness is an important component of the obviousness inquiry because 'evidence of secondary considerations may often be the most probative and cogent evidence in the record'\" [3].\n\n2. **Teaching Away**:\n   - If the prior art teaches away from the claimed invention, it can rebut obviousness. For example, \"evidence 'that the prior art teaches away from the claimed invention in any material respect' rebuts a prima facie case of obviousness\" [4].\n\n3. **Lack of Enablement in Prior Art**:\n   - If the prior art does not enable a person of ordinary skill to make and use the claimed invention, it cannot render the invention obvious. \"To render a later invention unpatentable for obviousness, the prior art must enable a person of ordinary skill in the field to make and use the later invention\" [5].\n\n4. **No Reasonable Expectation of Success**:\n   - A prima facie case of obviousness can be rebutted by showing that there was no reasonable expectation of success in combining the prior art references. For example, \"the district court\u2019s findings also support the conclusion that there could have been no reasonable expectation as to risedronate\u2019s success\" [6].\n\n5. **Evidence of Specific Challenges or Failures**:\n   - Evidence showing that the prior art did not suggest the specific combination or that the combination would not work as expected can also rebut obviousness. For example, \"the prior art must enable a person of ordinary skill in the field to make and use the later invention\" [7].\n\n## Practitioner Guidance:\nTo effectively rebut a prima facie case of obviousness, practitioners should:\n- Present robust evidence of objective indicia of nonobviousness, ensuring a clear nexus between the evidence and the claimed invention.\n- Highlight any teachings in the prior art that discourage or teach away from the claimed combination.\n- Demonstrate that the prior art does not enable the claimed invention or that there was no reasonable expectation of success in combining the references.\n- Use expert testimony and declarations to support arguments, particularly when addressing technical challenges or unexpected results.\n\n## CITATION_MAP:\n[1] IN RE JOHN B.

          "raw_response": "### Immediate Answer:\nUnder **35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101**, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in *Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International*, patent eligibility requires that the claimed invention:\n1. **Not be directed to a patent-ineligible concept** (e.g., laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas) (*Alice* Step 1) [Q125], [Q162].\n2. **Contain an \"inventive concept\"** sufficient to transform the ineligible concept into a patent-eligible application (*Alice* Step 2) [Q126], [Q173].\n\nUnder **35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(a)**, the written description requirement mandates that the patent specification must:\n1. **Reasonably convey to those skilled in the art** that the inventor had possession of the claimed invention as of the filing date [Q25], [Q224].\n2. Provide sufficient detail to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the invention [Q25].\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n#### **Patent Eligibility under Alice (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101):**\n1. **Step 1: Directed to a Patent-Ineligible Concept**  \n   The first step of the *Alice* framework requires determining whether the claims are directed to a patent-ineligible concept, such as an abstract idea, law of nature, or natural phenomenon [Q125], [Q162]. For example:\n   - Claims directed to \"intermediated settlement\" were found to be an abstract idea (*Alice*) [Q160].\n   - Claims involving a natural phenomenon, such as the correlation between metabolite levels and drug efficacy, were deemed ineligible (*Mayo*) [Q135], [Q267].\n\n2. **Step 2: Inventive Concept**  \n   If the claims are directed to a patent-ineligible concept, the second step examines whether the claims include an \"inventive concept\" that transforms the abstract idea into a patent-eligible application [Q126], [Q173]. This requires \"significantly more\" than merely stating the abstract idea and adding \"apply it\" [Q134], [Q173]. For example:\n   - Simply appending routine or conventional steps to a natural phenomenon does not satisfy this requirement (*Mayo*) [Q146], [Q184].\n\n#### **Written Description under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(a):**\n1. **Possession of the Invention**  \n   The written description must demonstrate that the inventor was in possession of the claimed invention at the time of filing. This is assessed by whether the specification reasonably conveys to a person skilled in the art that the inventor had possession of the invention [Q25], [Q224].\n\n2. **Enablement**  \n   The specification must provide sufficient detail to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the invention without undue experimentation [Q25].\n\n---\n\n### Practitioner Guidance:\n1. **For \u00a7 101 (Alice):**\n   - Draft claims to focus on specific applications or technological improvements rather than abstract ideas or natural laws [Q282].\n   - Avoid claims that merely recite generic computer implementation or conventional steps [Q168], [Q184].\n\n2. **For \u00a7 112(a):**\n   - Ensure the specification provides detailed support for all claimed elements and demonstrates possession of the invention [Q25].\n   - Include examples, diagrams, and descriptions of how the invention works to satisfy the enablement requirement [Q25].\n\n---\n\n### CITATION_MAP:\n[Q25] Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. v.

          "raw_response": "## Immediate Answer:\nObviousness analysis under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 focuses on whether the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention, considering the prior art. In contrast, the written description requirement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 ensures that the patent specification demonstrates that the inventor was in possession of the claimed invention at the time of filing, particularly by adequately describing the claimed genus and its scope.\n\n## Detailed Analysis:\n\n### Obviousness Analysis:\nObviousness under \u00a7 103 involves determining whether the claimed invention would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the prior art. The analysis requires:\n1. Determining the scope and content of the prior art.\n2. Identifying differences between the prior art and the claimed invention.\n3. Assessing the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.\n4. Considering secondary indicia of nonobviousness, such as commercial success, long-felt but unsolved needs, and failure of others. [Q67], [Q68], [Q69].\n\nFor genus claims, obviousness analysis evaluates whether the prior art would have motivated a skilled artisan to pursue the claimed genus and whether there was a reasonable expectation of success in achieving the claimed invention. For example, in *Eli Lilly and Company v. Teva Pharmaceuticals*, the court emphasized that a patent challenger must show both a motivation to combine prior art references and a reasonable expectation of success in achieving the claimed invention. [Q20], [Q23].\n\n### Written Description Requirement:\nThe written description requirement under \u00a7 112 ensures that the patent specification adequately demonstrates that the inventor was in possession of the claimed invention at the time of filing. For genus claims, this requirement is particularly stringent because the specification must either:\n1. Disclose a representative number of species within the genus, or\n2. Identify structural features common to the members of the genus, enabling a skilled artisan to \"visualize or recognize\" the members of the genus. [Q186], [Q193].\n\nThe written description requirement is not satisfied by merely stating the boundaries of the genus or by describing the desired result of the genus. Instead, the specification must provide sufficient detail to distinguish the genus from other materials and demonstrate that the inventor actually invented the claimed genus. [Q186], [Q193], [Q194].\n\nFor example, in *Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Co.*, the court emphasized that a generic claim must be supported by a written description that demonstrates the inventor's possession of the claimed genus, either through representative species or common structural features. The court rejected the notion that merely drawing a \"fence\" around a genus or claiming a desired result satisfies the written description requirement. [Q186], [Q190], [Q191].\n\n### Key Differences:\n1. **Focus**:\n   - **Obviousness**: Focuses on whether the invention would have been obvious to a skilled artisan based on prior art.\n   - **Written Description**: Focuses on whether the inventor adequately disclosed the invention in the specification to demonstrate possession.\n\n2. **Timing**:\n   - **Obviousness**: Evaluated as of the time of invention, considering the state of the prior art.\n   - **Written Description**: Evaluated as of the filing date of the patent application.\n\n3. **Purpose**:\n   - **Obviousness**: Prevents granting patents for inventions that lack sufficient inventive step over the prior art.\n   - **Written Description**: Ensures that the inventor has fully disclosed the invention and its scope to the public in exchange for the patent monopoly.\n\n4. **Application to Genus Claims**:\n   - **Obviousness**: Considers whether a skilled artisan would have been motivated to pursue the claimed genus and had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so. [Q20], [Q23].\n   - **Written Description**: Requires the specification to disclose either representative species or common structural features to demonstrate possession of the claimed genus. [Q186], [Q193].\n\n## Practitioner Guidance:\n1. **For Obviousness**: Focus on demonstrating the differences between the claimed genus and the prior art, and argue against any reasonable expectation of success in achieving the claimed invention.\n2. **For Written Description**: Ensure the specification includes sufficient detail to demonstrate possession of the claimed genus, either through representative species or common structural features.\n3. **Pitfalls**: Avoid relying solely on functional language or broad generalizations in the specification, as these may fail to satisfy the written description requirement. Similarly, ensure that the claimed genus is not rendered obvious by prior art disclosures.\n\n## CITATION_MAP:\n[Q20] *Eli Lilly and Company v.

          "raw_response": "The Therasense materiality standard for inequitable conduct requires \"but-for materiality,\" meaning that the undisclosed information or misrepresentation must be such that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) would not have allowed the claim had it been aware of the information. Specifically, the court must determine whether the PTO would have allowed the claim if it had been aware of the undisclosed reference, applying the preponderance of the evidence standard and giving the claims their broadest reasonable construction. This standard is stricter than the previously used \"reasonable examiner\" standard.\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n1. **Definition of But-For Materiality**: \n   - \"The standard for 'the materiality required to establish inequitable conduct is but-for materiality.'\u201d [1]\n   - \"Undisclosed prior art is 'but-for material if the PTO would not have allowed a claim had it been aware of' it.\" [1]\n   - \"The court should apply the preponderance of the evidence standard and give claims their broadest reasonable construction.\" [1]\n\n2. **Application of the Standard**:\n   - Even if a district court does not invalidate a claim based on a deliberately withheld reference, the reference may still be material if it would have blocked patent issuance under the PTO\u2019s evidentiary standards. [1]\n   - The materiality standard applies to withheld prior art and other information that could affect the patentability of claims. [1]\n\n3. **Exceptions**:\n   - The Therasense decision also recognizes an exception for \"affirmative egregious misconduct,\" such as the filing of an unmistakably false affidavit, which can render the misconduct material even if it does not meet the but-for standard. [2]\n\n## Practitioner Guidance\n- When asserting inequitable conduct, practitioners must provide clear and convincing evidence that the withheld information was but-for material to the patentability of the claims.\n- It is critical to analyze whether the PTO would have rejected the claims under its standards if the information had been disclosed.\n- Be cautious of the exception for egregious misconduct, as it can bypass the but-for materiality requirement.\n\nCITATION_MAP:\n[1] AMERICAN CALCAR, INC. v.

          "raw_response": "The doctrine of equivalents allows a patentee to claim infringement for insubstantial alterations to a patented invention that were not literally captured in the patent claims. However, the doctrine is limited by prosecution history estoppel, which prevents a patentee from recapturing subject matter surrendered during prosecution to obtain a patent. After the Supreme Court's decision in *Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co.*, 535 U.S. 722 (2002) (\"Festo VIII\"), the application of prosecution history estoppel to the doctrine of equivalents was clarified and refined.\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n1. **Presumption of Surrender**: \n   The Supreme Court in *Festo VIII* held that when a patentee narrows a claim during prosecution for a substantial reason related to patentability, there is a presumption that the patentee has surrendered all equivalents within the territory between the original claim and the amended claim. This presumption applies to any narrowing amendment made to satisfy a requirement of the Patent Act. As stated in *Festo VIII*, \"A patentee\u2019s decision to narrow his claims through amendment may be presumed to be a general disclaimer of the territory between the original claim and the amended claim.\" [Q16].\n\n2. **Rebutting the Presumption**:\n   The Supreme Court also established that the presumption of surrender is not absolute and can be rebutted if the patentee demonstrates one of three exceptions:\n   - The alleged equivalent was **unforeseeable** at the time of the amendment.\n   - The rationale underlying the amendment bears **no more than a tangential relation** to the equivalent in question.\n   - There is **some other reason** suggesting that the patentee could not reasonably have been expected to describe the alleged equivalent. [Q16], [Q144].\n\n3. **Foreseeability**:\n   Foreseeability is determined at the time of the amendment and asks whether the alleged equivalent was \"readily known\" to one of ordinary skill in the art. As clarified in *Festo VIII*, \"Foreseeability means 'readily known equivalents,' not unknown equivalents developed a decade later.\" [Q170].\n\n4. **Tangential Relation**:\n   The tangential exception applies when the reason for the narrowing amendment is peripheral or not directly relevant to the alleged equivalent. The inquiry focuses on the patentee\u2019s \"objectively apparent reason for the narrowing amendment,\" which must be discernible from the prosecution history. [Q144], [Q172].\n\n5. **Application of the Doctrine Post-*Festo***:\n   - In *Eli Lilly and Company v. Hospira, Inc.*, the court held that the tangential exception applied because the reason for the amendment was to distinguish the claimed invention from prior art, and the specific equivalent at issue (a different salt form) was not directly related to the rationale for the amendment. [Q121], [Q128].\n   - In *Honeywell International Inc. v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp.*, the court emphasized that the foreseeability analysis must be directed to the particular equivalent in question and that unforeseeable equivalents developed after the amendment are not barred by prosecution history estoppel. [Q172].\n\n6. **Legal and Procedural Considerations**:\n   Prosecution history estoppel is a legal limitation on the doctrine of equivalents and is decided as a matter of law by the court. The burden of persuasion lies with the patentee to rebut the presumption of surrender. [Q180].\n\n## Practitioner Guidance\n\n1. **Careful Drafting and Prosecution**:\n   Patent applicants should carefully consider the scope of amendments made during prosecution and ensure that the record clearly reflects the rationale for any narrowing amendments to preserve potential equivalents.\n\n2. **Rebutting the Presumption**:\n   To rebut the presumption of surrender, practitioners should focus on demonstrating that the equivalent was unforeseeable, tangential to the amendment, or otherwise outside the scope of what was surrendered. This requires a thorough analysis of the prosecution history and the state of the art at the time of the amendment.\n\n3. **Litigation Strategy**:\n   In litigation, defendants should scrutinize the prosecution history to argue that the patentee surrendered the equivalent in question. Conversely, patentees should emphasize any ambiguities or gaps in the prosecution history to argue that the equivalent was not surrendered.\n\nCITATION_MAP:\n[Q16] *Festo Corp. v.

[Q39], [Q38].\n\n2. **Overcoming the Presumption**: The presumption against applying \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 to a term that lacks the word \"means\" can be overcome if the challenger demonstrates that the claim term:\n   - Fails to \"recite sufficiently definite structure,\" or\n   - Recites \"function without reciting sufficient structure for performing that function.\" [Q39], [Q71], [Q73].\n\n3. **Essential Inquiry**: The essential inquiry is \"whether the words of the claim are understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art to have a sufficiently definite meaning as the name for structure.\" [Q34], [Q117].\n\n4. **Sufficient Structure**: A claim term is deemed to recite sufficient structure if it is used in common parlance or by persons of skill in the pertinent art to designate structure, even if the term covers a broad class of structures or identifies the structures by their function. [Q115].\n\n5. **Claim Language and Specification**: In determining whether a claim term recites sufficient structure, the claim language and the specification are analyzed. If the claim term does not inherently connote structure and the specification fails to provide sufficient structural detail, the term will be treated as a means-plus-function limitation.

          "raw_response": "The correct framework for evaluating the motivation to combine references in an obviousness analysis is provided by **Graham v. John Deere Co.**, as clarified and expanded upon by **KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc.** Both cases are foundational, but KSR refined the application of the Graham framework, particularly with respect to the flexibility of the motivation-to-combine analysis.\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n1. **Graham Framework**:  \n   Graham established the foundational framework for determining obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. It requires courts to consider:\n   - The scope and content of the prior art,\n   - The differences between the prior art and the claims at issue,\n   - The level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art, and\n   - Secondary considerations, such as commercial success, long-felt but unsolved needs, and failure of others.  \n   [Q202], [Q203], [Q278], [Q279]\n\n   Graham emphasized that the ultimate question of obviousness is a legal determination based on these factual inquiries. [Q202], [Q203]\n\n2. **KSR Refinement**:  \n   KSR built upon Graham by rejecting rigid and formalistic approaches to the motivation-to-combine analysis, such as the strict application of the \"teaching, suggestion, or motivation\" (TSM) test. The Supreme Court in KSR emphasized that the obviousness inquiry must be \"expansive and flexible\" and that courts should avoid \"rigid, preventative rules that deny factfinders recourse to common sense.\" [Q206], [Q218], [Q219]\n\n   KSR clarified that a motivation to combine references can arise from:\n   - The nature of the problem to be solved,\n   - Design incentives or market pressures,\n   - Common sense, or\n   - A showing that it would have been \"obvious to try\" a finite number of predictable solutions. [Q206], [Q207], [Q240], [Q241], [Q242]\n\n   The Court in KSR also emphasized that the analysis should focus on whether a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine prior art references, not merely whether they could have done so. [Q206], [Q283]\n\n3. **Interplay Between Graham and KSR**:  \n   While Graham provides the foundational framework, KSR clarified how to apply it in practice, particularly by emphasizing flexibility and rejecting rigid rules like the TSM test. The Federal Circuit has consistently applied this combined framework in subsequent cases. For example:\n   - In **Virtek Vision International Ulc v. Assembly Guidance Systems, Inc.**, the court reiterated that obviousness requires a motivation to combine references and that merely showing that elements were \"known\" in the prior art is insufficient. [Q280], [Q283], [Q284]\n   - In **LKQ Corporation v. GM Global Technology Operations LLC**, the court noted that KSR emphasized an expansive and flexible approach to obviousness, rejecting rigid rules like the Rosen-Durling test for design patents. [Q218], [Q219], [Q221]\n\n## Practitioner Guidance\n\n- **Graham remains the foundation**: Always begin with the Graham factors when analyzing obviousness.\n- **Incorporate KSR's flexibility**: Avoid rigid application of the TSM test or other formalistic rules. Consider whether a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine references based on practical, real-world considerations, such as design needs, market pressures, or common sense.\n- **Evidence is key**: Ensure that there is substantial evidence supporting the motivation to combine. Conclusory statements or mere assertions that elements were \"known\" in the prior art are insufficient. [Q283], [Q285]\n- **Secondary considerations**: Do not overlook secondary considerations, as they can provide critical evidence of nonobviousness. However, a strong showing of prima facie obviousness may outweigh weak secondary considerations. [Q299], [Q300]\n\n## CITATION_MAP:\n[Q202] Graham v. John Deere Co.

See \nPrometheus, 132 S. Ct. at 1303-04.  District courts have \ngreat discretion to control the conduct of proceedings \nbefore them, including the order of presentation of issues \nand evidence and the sequence of events proscribed by the \nFederal Rules and leading up to judgment.   See, e.g., \nAmado v. Microsoft Corp., 517 F.3d 1353, 1358 (Fed. Cir. \n2008) (\u201cDistrict courts . . . are afforded broad discretion to \ncontrol and manage their dockets, including the authority \nto decide the order in which they hear and decide issues \npending before them.\u201d).  Although \u00a7 101 has been \ncharacterized as a \u201cthreshold test,\u201d Bilski II, 130 S. Ct. at \n3225, and certainly can be addressed before other matters \ntouching the validity of patents, it need not always be \naddressed first, particularly when other sections might be \ndiscerned by the trial judge as having the promise to \nresolve a dispute more expeditiously or with more clarity \nand predictability.  See MySpace, Inc. v. GraphOn Corp., \n672 F.3d 1250, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2012).  Thus, consistent \nwith its role as the master of its own docket, a district \ncourt properly acts within its discretion in deciding when \nto address the diverse statutory challenges to validity.   \nHere, the district court exercised its discretion to \nentertain a challenge to the validity of the patents in suit \nunder 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.  The district court\u2019s decision \nultimately turned on, and thus this appeal is primarily \ndirected to, the issue of whether the claimed inventions \nfall within the \u201cabstract ideas\u201d exception to patent \neligibility.  While the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in \nPrometheus reiterated the trilogy of \u201cimplicit\u201d exceptions \nto patent eligibility, including the exception for abstract \nideas, it did not directly address how to determine ",

In Alice, the Supreme Court held that a method \nof exchanging financial obligations  was drawn to an \nabstract idea.  134 S. Ct. at 2356\u201357.  Likewise, in Bilski, \nthe Court determined that a claim to a method of hedging \nrisk was directed to an abstract i dea.  561 U.S. at 611.  \nHere, Applicants\u2019 claimed \u201cmethod of conducting a wager-\ning game\u201d is drawn to an abstract idea much like Alice \u2019s \nmethod of exchanging financial obliga tions and Bilski\u2019s \nmethod of hedging risk.   \nMoreover, our own cases have denied patentability of \nsimilar concepts as being directed towards ineligible \nsubject matter.

Under \u201cthe longstand\u00ad\ning rule that \u2018[a]n idea of itself is not patentable,\u2019 \u201d Gottschalk v. Ben\u00ad\nson, 409 U.

It follows from these cases, and Bilski in particular, that the\nclaims at issue are directed to an abstract idea.  On their face, they\nare drawn to the concept of intermediated settlement, i.e., the use of \na third party to mitigate settlement risk.  Like the risk hedging in \nBilski, the concept of intermediated settlement is \u201c \u2018a fundamental\neconomic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce,\u2019 \u201d ibid., \nand the use of a thirdparty intermediary (or \u201cclearing house\u201d) is a\nbuilding block of the modern economy.  Thus, intermediated settle\u00ad\nment, like hedging, is an \u201cabstract idea\u201d beyond \u00a7101\u2019s scope.  Pp. 7\u2013 \n10. \n(2) Turning to t",

          "raw_response": "The provided excerpts do not explicitly define what amount of experimentation is considered \"undue\" under the Wands factors for biological claims. However, the Wands factors themselves are referenced in multiple excerpts as the framework for determining whether the required experimentation is undue. These factors include:\n\n1. The quantity of experimentation necessary.\n2. The amount of direction or guidance presented in the specification.\n3. The presence or absence of working examples.\n4. The nature of the invention.\n5. The state of the prior art.\n6. The relative skill of those in the art.\n7. The predictability or unpredictability of the art.\n8. The breadth of the claims.\n\nThe determination of undue experimentation is described as a conclusion reached by weighing these factual considerations. For example:\n\n- In *Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi*, the court noted that \"whether undue experimentation is needed is not a single, simple factual determination, but rather is a conclusion reached by weighing many factual considerations\" [Q7], [Q123].\n- In *Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.*, the court emphasized that the specification must enable the creation of a claimed invention without undue experimentation, particularly when the claims require both structural and functional limitations [Q152], [Q153], [Q155].\n- In *Idenix Pharmaceuticals LLC v. Gilead Sciences Inc.*, the court found that the quantity of experimentation required to determine which compounds met the claimed functionality was very high, favoring a finding of non-enablement [Q147].\n\nThe excerpts suggest that undue experimentation is more likely to be found when:\n- The claims are broad and encompass numerous potential embodiments.\n- The specification provides limited guidance or working examples.\n- The field is unpredictable, such as in biological or chemical arts.\n- The experimentation required involves significant trial and error or is akin to finding a \"needle in a haystack\" [Q10], [Q152], [Q155].\n\nCITATION_MAP:\n[Q7] Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi (20-1074) | Page 7 | \"Whether undue experimentation is needed is not a single, simple factual determination, but rather is a conclusion reached by weighing many factual considerations.\"\n[Q123] Streck v. Research & Diagnostic (2011-1044) | Page 31 | \"Whether undue experimentation is required 'is not a single, simple factual determination, but rather is a conclusion reached by weighing many factual considerations.'\"\n[Q147] Idenix Pharmaceuticals LLC v. Gilead Sciences Inc. (18-1691) | Page 9 | \"We agree with the district court that the quantity of experimentation required to determine which 2'-methyl-up nucleosides meet claim 1 is very high, which favors a finding of non-enablement.\"\n[Q152] Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. (17-2498) | Page 10 | \"In Wyeth, we affirmed a grant of summary judgment and held the asserted claims invalid for lack of enablement because it would have required undue experimentation to determine which compounds in the claimed class would have the required functionality.\"\n[Q153] Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. (17-2498) | Page 10 | \"With this focus on the functionality required by the claims, we agree with Appellees that our decision in Wyeth and Cordis Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories, 720 F.3d 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2013), controls this case.\"\n[Q155] Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. (17-2498) | Page 10 | \"We thus concluded that there was no genuine dispute that practicing the full scope of the claims would require undue experimentation.\"\n\n## Suggested Next Steps\n1. Request clarification on whether the user seeks specific examples of undue experimentation in biological claims or a general explanation of the Wands factors.\n2. Investigate whether the user is interested in a particular case or type of biological claim (e.g., antibodies, nucleotides).\n3. Explore additional case law or examples where the Wands factors were applied to biological claims, if available.",

          "raw_response": "Courts apply the full scope of enablement requirement to genus claims by assessing whether the patent's specification enables a person of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the full scope of the claimed genus without undue experimentation. This analysis often involves evaluating the breadth of the claims, the predictability of the field, and the guidance provided in the specification. The courts rely on the factors established in *In re Wands*, which include considerations such as the quantity of experimentation necessary, the amount of guidance provided, the presence or absence of working examples, and the predictability of the art.\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n1. **Full Scope Enablement Requirement**:\n   - The specification must enable the full scope of the claimed genus, not just a subset of embodiments. As stated in *Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi*, \u201cthe specification must enable the full scope of the invention as defined by its claims,\u201d allowing for \u201ca reasonable amount of experimentation.\u201d [1]\n   - For genus claims, this means the patent must provide sufficient guidance to enable a skilled artisan to make and use all species within the genus, not just a few representative examples. If the genus is broad and encompasses numerous species, the specification must provide enough detail to allow the skilled artisan to practice the entire scope without undue experimentation.\n\n2. **Role of the *Wands* Factors**:\n   - Courts evaluate enablement using the *Wands* factors, which include:\n     - The quantity of experimentation necessary.\n     - The amount of direction or guidance provided in the specification.\n     - The presence or absence of working examples.\n     - The predictability or unpredictability of the art.\n     - The breadth of the claims.\n   - For example, in *Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi*, the court found that the claims were not enabled because the specification did not provide sufficient guidance to allow a skilled artisan to make and use the full scope of the claimed antibodies without undue experimentation. The claims covered \u201cmillions\u201d of antibodies, and the specification disclosed only 26 examples, leaving the skilled artisan to engage in \u201ctrial-and-error discovery\u201d to identify other antibodies within the genus. [1], [2], [3]\n\n3. **Functional Limitations and Undue Experimentation**:\n   - Functional limitations in genus claims can increase the burden of enablement. If the claims are defined by functional requirements (e.g., antibodies that bind to a specific target), the specification must provide sufficient guidance to enable a skilled artisan to identify all species that meet the functional requirements without undue experimentation.\n   - In *Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi*, the Supreme Court emphasized that the specification must disclose \u201ca quality common to every functional embodiment\u201d of the genus. Without such a unifying characteristic, the skilled artisan would be left to perform extensive trial-and-error experimentation, which is considered undue. [1], [2], [3]\n\n4. **Case Comparisons**:\n   - In *Wyeth & Cordis Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories*, the court found that claims covering methods of preventing restenosis with compounds having certain functionality requirements were not enabled because the specification failed to teach how to identify compounds meeting the functional limitations without undue experimentation. [4]\n   - Similarly, in *Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. v. Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.*, the court held that the claims were not enabled because the specification did not provide sufficient guidance to determine whether the many embodiments of the broad claims would exhibit the required functionality. [5]\n   - In *Idenix Pharmaceuticals LLC v. Gilead Sciences Inc.*, the court found that the claims were not enabled because the specification failed to provide sufficient guidance to identify functional compounds within a vast genus, making the process akin to finding a \u201cneedle in a haystack.\u201d [6]\n\n5. **Unpredictable Fields of Science**:\n   - In unpredictable fields, such as antibody science, the enablement requirement is particularly stringent. Minor changes in chemical structure can significantly alter functionality, making it difficult for a skilled artisan to predict which species within the genus will meet the claimed requirements. [1], [2], [3]\n\n## Practitioner Guidance\n\n1. **Provide Representative Examples**: To satisfy the full scope enablement requirement, include a sufficient number of representative examples that cover the breadth of the claimed genus.\n2. **Disclose a Common Quality**: For functional genus claims, identify a unifying structural or functional quality that is common to all species within the genus.\n3. **Avoid Overly Broad Claims**: Narrow the scope of genus claims to ensure that the specification can reasonably enable the full scope without undue experimentation.\n4. **Anticipate Enablement Challenges**: Be prepared to address potential enablement challenges by providing evidence that the disclosed examples and guidance are sufficient to enable the full scope of the claims.\n\n## CITATION_MAP:\n[1] *Amgen Inc. v.

          "raw_response": "## Immediate Answer:\nEvidence that rebuts a prima facie case of obviousness for combining prior art references includes unexpected results, teaching away by the prior art, lack of motivation to combine, and secondary considerations such as commercial success, long-felt but unmet needs, and failure of others. These factors must be considered collectively with the prima facie case to determine obviousness.\n\n## Detailed Analysis:\n1. **Unexpected Results**: Evidence showing that the claimed invention exhibits properties or advantages that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have predicted based on the prior art can rebut a prima facie case of obviousness. For example, \"evidence of unexpected results\" is explicitly recognized as a valid rebuttal to a prima facie case of obviousness. [Q103], [Q114].\n\n2. **Teaching Away**: If the prior art teaches away from the claimed invention, it can rebut a prima facie case of obviousness. Teaching away occurs when the prior art discourages the path taken by the inventor or suggests that the claimed invention would not work. For instance, \"evidence that the prior art teaches away from the claimed invention in any material respect\" is a recognized rebuttal. [Q104], [Q112].\n\n3. **Lack of Motivation to Combine**: A prima facie case of obviousness often relies on a showing that there was a motivation to combine prior art references. If evidence demonstrates that there was no reason or motivation for a person of ordinary skill in the art to combine the references, the prima facie case can be rebutted. For example, \"it remains necessary to identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner to establish prima facie obviousness of a new claimed compound.\" [Q259].\n\n4. **Secondary Considerations**: Secondary considerations, also known as objective indicia of nonobviousness, include factors such as commercial success, long-felt but unmet needs, failure of others, and industry praise. These considerations are critical in assessing the overall obviousness determination and must be considered as part of the totality of evidence. For example, \"evidence rising out of the so-called 'secondary considerations' must always when present be considered en route to a determination of obviousness.\" [Q156], [Q287].\n\n5. **Enablement of Prior Art**: If the prior art does not enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the claimed invention, it can rebut a prima facie case of obviousness. For instance, \"the prior art must enable a person of ordinary skill in the field to make and use the later invention.\" [Q243].\n\n6. **Collective Consideration of Evidence**: The decision-maker must consider all evidence, including rebuttal evidence, collectively and not in isolation. For example, \"the entirety of the evidence must be reviewed in order to determine whether the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field.\" [Q245].\n\n## Practitioner Guidance:\n- **Strategic Use of Evidence**: When rebutting a prima facie case of obviousness, focus on presenting robust evidence of unexpected results, teaching away, or secondary considerations. Ensure that the evidence is specific, credible, and directly relevant to the claimed invention.\n- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Advocate for the collective consideration of all evidence, including rebuttal evidence, to ensure that the decision-maker does not improperly isolate individual factors.\n- **Highlight Gaps in Motivation**: Emphasize any lack of motivation to combine prior art references or any evidence showing that the combination would not have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n## CITATION_MAP:\n[Q103] IN RE JOHN B.
