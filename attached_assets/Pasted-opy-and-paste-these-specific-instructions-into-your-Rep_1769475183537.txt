opy and paste these specific instructions into your Replit Agent chat to diagnose and fix the performance:Step 1: The "Zombies" Audit"I am getting a 'Potentially relevant cases found but not yet indexed' error for foundational cases like Phillips v. AWH Corp. and Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank.Task: Audit the document ingestion pipeline. Specifically:Check the logs for RateLimitError or OOM (Out of Memory) errors during the last embedding run.List all files currently in the vector store that have a status: 'failed' or usage_bytes: 0.Verify if the embedding model is successfully converting the text of these PDFs into vectors, or if it is only indexing the metadata (filenames)."Step 2: The "Semantic Chunking" Fix"The bot currently fails to retrieve specific legal tests (like the Graham factors or Alice Step 1) even when the case is listed.Task: Modify the chunking strategy in the ingestion script.Change the chunk size to 1,200 tokens with a 200-token overlap.Implement RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to ensure that multi-paragraph legal holdings aren't cut in half.Add a 'Document Summary' metadata tag to every chunk so the retriever knows the global context of the case regardless of which page it's on."Step 3: Enable "Hybrid Search""The current retrieval is too reliant on exact keyword matches.Task: Update the retrieval function to use Hybrid Search. Combine the current Vector Search (semantic) with a BM25 Keyword Search. This will ensure that when I search for a specific case name or a statute like '103 obviousness,' the system prioritizes those exact terms before trying to find semantically similar text."Global Performance ChecklistIf you are doing the "vibe coding" approach on Replit, ensure these three technical settings are optimized:FeatureTarget SettingWhy?Top-K RetrievalIncrease from 3 to 7Legal queries often require context from multiple pages of an opinion.TemperatureSet to 0.0 or 0.1For a legal bot, you want zero "creativity" and 100% factual retrieval.System PromptAdd: "If RAG fails, use internal knowledge but label it as 'General Legal Principles'."This prevents the frustrating "Not Found" wall and allows the bot to still be helpful.Why this happened (The "Technical Post-Mortem")In legal RAG systems, Standard PDFs are the enemy. They often contain multi-column text, headers, and footers that "poison" the embeddings. If your bot isn't reading Phillips, it's likely because the PDF parser got stuck on a table of contents or a cover page and stopped reading before it hit the actual "holding."
