We are still getting repeated evaluation crashes:

ERROR - Query <id> failed: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'

This is corrupting Phase 1 metrics (trigger rate = 0, NOT FOUND = 100%, latency spikes) and makes all summaries meaningless.

ROOT CAUSE
Some fallback-generated `sources` are strings, but downstream code assumes every source is a dict and calls `.get()`. Once a string reaches eval aggregation, the query crashes and poisons the report.

TASKS (ALL REQUIRED — NO NEW FEATURES)

1) Enforce a strict invariant:
   Every element in `sources` MUST be a dict. Strings are never allowed past construction.

2) Add a normalization function (or equivalent inline logic):

   def normalize_source(obj):
       if isinstance(obj, str):
           return {
               "text": obj,
               "tier": "unverified",
               "binding_failed": True,
               "binding_method": "none",
           }
       if isinstance(obj, dict):
           obj.setdefault("tier", "unverified")
           obj.setdefault("binding_failed", False)
           obj.setdefault("binding_method", "none")
           return obj
       raise TypeError(f"Invalid source type: {type(obj)}")

3) Apply normalize_source() EVERYWHERE sources are created or appended, including:
   - fallback source generation
   - citation marker processing
   - web-search fallback ingestion
   - any path contributing to `sources`, `retrieval_delta`, or eval artifacts

4) Add a hard assertion during eval/report generation (eval-only is fine):
   assert all(isinstance(s, dict) for s in sources)
   so this bug can never silently recur.

5) Add a regression test:
   - Simulate a fallback path that previously produced a string
   - Assert eval completes without exception
   - Assert resulting source has tier == "unverified"

6) Re-run verification:
   pytest -q
   SMART_QUERY_DECOMPOSE_ENABLED=true python -m backend.smart.eval_phase1 --compare --queries 12 --query_file backend/smart/eval_queries_trigger.json

CONFIRM SUCCESS WHEN:
- ZERO `'str' object has no attribute 'get'` errors
- All 12 queries complete
- Phase 1 summary metrics are non-degenerate and stable

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT add Phase 2 features
- Do NOT change core retrieval, ranking, prompting, or citation logic
- This is a correctness and robustness fix only
