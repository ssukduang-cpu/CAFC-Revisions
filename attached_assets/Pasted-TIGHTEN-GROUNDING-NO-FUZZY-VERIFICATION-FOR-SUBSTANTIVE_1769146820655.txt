TIGHTEN GROUNDING: NO FUZZY VERIFICATION FOR SUBSTANTIVE CLAIMS

Current behavior: some claims render with “Unverified” citations, and backend verifies quotes using fuzzy word matching (60% threshold). This violates the “hallucinations forbidden” requirement.

Make these changes:

1) Replace fuzzy verification with strict quote verification
- Verification must be deterministic:
  a) Normalize both quote and page text with the SAME function:
     - Unicode normalize (NFKC)
     - convert CRLF to LF
     - collapse whitespace to single spaces
     - do NOT remove punctuation entirely (only normalize whitespace)
  b) Verified = normalized_quote is an exact substring of normalized_page_text for (opinion_id, page_number).
- Remove fuzzy matching entirely for “verified=true”.

2) Enforce “no verified citations => NOT FOUND” at the claim level
- For each claim:
  - keep only citations where verified=true AND page_number >= 1
  - if a claim ends with 0 verified citations, REPLACE the claim text with:
    "NOT FOUND IN PROVIDED OPINIONS."
  - mark the claim as unsupported in support_audit
- Do not display substantive claim text with only unverified citations.

3) Ensure every citation has a valid page_number
- If retrieval cannot confidently assign a page_number, do NOT create that citation.
- Never emit page_number=0. Treat as invalid/unverified and drop it.

4) Ensure quotes are always exact substrings (no ellipses or paraphrase)
- When creating a quote snippet:
  - Select a contiguous span directly from the stored page text (e.g., 80–300 chars).
  - Do NOT insert “...” into the stored quote.
  - If you need to shorten for UI, store the full exact substring and let UI truncate visually.

5) Regenerate unsupported claims by re-retrieving the best pages
- If a claim is unsupported after strict verification:
  - Attempt one retry: retrieve top pages again (FTS query) and select exact quotes.
  - If still unsupported, output NOT FOUND IN PROVIDED OPINIONS for that claim.

6) UI adjustments
- Only show “Sources” cards for verified citations.
- If claim is NOT FOUND, show a small hint: “Try ingesting additional relevant opinions or refine keywords.”

Acceptance test:
- Ask: “What did the court decide in Conklin?”
- All non-NOT FOUND claims must have at least one green (verified) citation with (case_name, appeal_no, release_date, page_number).
- No claim may be displayed with only amber/unverified citations.
