HARDEN GROUNDED ANSWERS + FIX CITATIONS

Current UI shows claim-by-claim answers with quotes and citations, but citations are missing release_date and hallucination-prevention is not structurally enforced. Implement the following:

1) Citation schema upgrade (backend)
- Ensure each citation object ALWAYS includes:
  { opinion_id, case_name, appeal_no, release_date, page_number, quote }
- release_date must come from the opinions table for that opinion_id.
- Update /api/chat response shape accordingly.

2) Server-side quote verification (mandatory)
- After retrieval selects passages (opinion_id + page_number + text), and after the assistant drafts claims:
  For each claim, require >=1 citation whose quote is VERIFIED:
    - The quote string must be an exact substring of the stored opinion_pages.text for that opinion_id AND page_number.
- If a claim has no verified citations, replace that claim text with:
  "NOT FOUND IN PROVIDED OPINIONS."
  and include an empty citations list for that claim.
- Never output an unsupported claim.

3) Support Audit in response JSON
- Return:
  {
    answer: "...",
    claims: [
      { id: 1, text: "...", citations: [ ...verified citations... ] },
      ...
    ],
    support_audit: { total_claims, supported_claims, unsupported_claims }
  }
- The UI should render the claims list (not a single blob) and show citations under each claim.

4) UI updates
- In the message render, show citations as:
  (CASE NAME, Appeal No. X, Release Date YYYY-MM-DD, Page N)
- Update the Sources panel cards to display release_date too.

5) Regression tests
- Add a test that asks an unrelated question (e.g., "Explain Alice/Mayo") when only CONKLIN is ingested and verify the response contains ONLY "NOT FOUND IN PROVIDED OPINIONS" for unsupported claims.
- Add a test that asks the standard-of-review question and verifies citations include release_date and that quotes are substrings of stored page text.

Implement these changes in the existing FastAPI backend and the React UI. Ensure the preview still works end-to-end.
