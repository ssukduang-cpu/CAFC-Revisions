You are a senior backend engineer performing the FINAL “Phase 1 Smartness Go/No-Go Run” for the CAFC Opinion Assistant. Phase 1 (query decomposition + embeddings fallback) is already implemented behind feature flags and verified as fail-soft. Your task is to RUN, MEASURE, and SUMMARIZE—NOT to refactor or add features.

NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS
1) Do NOT modify any core legal engine logic:
   - doctrine classification
   - Postgres FTS retrieval
   - precedence-aware ranking scorer
   - controlling SCOTUS injection
   - quotable passage extraction
   - context build/pruning
   - LLM prompt strategy (quote-first)
   - citation verification
   - web search fallback ingestion
2) Do NOT change default flag values in code.
3) Only execute scripts, collect metrics, and summarize results.
4) Any scripts added previously (eval, fail-soft) may be executed but not rewritten.

GOALS
A) Confirm baseline stability (flags OFF)
- Run:
  ./scripts/voyager_verify.sh
- Confirm:
  - OVERALL: PASS
  - No regressions reported

B) Measure Phase 1 impact — Query Decomposition ONLY
- Set environment:
  SMART_QUERY_DECOMPOSE_ENABLED=true
  SMART_EMBED_RECALL_ENABLED=false
- Run:
  python -m backend.smart.eval_phase1 --compare
- Capture metrics:
  - NOT FOUND rate (baseline vs decomposed)
  - verified citation count / tiers
  - latency delta

C) Measure Phase 1 impact — Decomposition + Embeddings
- Confirm embeddings exist; if not, build once:
  python -m backend.smart.build_embeddings --all
- Set environment:
  SMART_EMBED_RECALL_ENABLED=true
- Re-run:
  python -m backend.smart.eval_phase1 --compare
- Capture same metrics as (B)

D) Summarize Results
Produce a concise summary with:
1) Baseline status (PASS/FAIL)
2) Query decomposition impact:
   - NOT FOUND delta
   - citation delta
   - latency delta
3) Embeddings fallback impact:
   - NOT FOUND delta
   - citation delta
   - latency delta
4) Clear recommendation:
   - Enable query decomposition by default for thin-retrieval cases? (YES/NO)
   - Enable embeddings fallback only for NOT FOUND / thin retrieval? (YES/NO)
   - Keep any feature gated? (YES/NO + reason)

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
Return:
1) “PHASE 1 FINAL RESULTS” section
2) Bullet-point metric deltas
3) One-paragraph recommendation
4) Explicit confirmation that no core components were modified

IMPORTANT
- If any metric worsens (higher NOT FOUND, lower verified citations), do NOT attempt to fix the engine.
- Simply report the affected queries and recommend tighter gating.
- This prompt is for decision-making, not further development.
