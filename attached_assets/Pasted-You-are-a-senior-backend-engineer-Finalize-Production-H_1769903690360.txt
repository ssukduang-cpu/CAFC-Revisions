You are a senior backend engineer. Finalize “Production Hardening – Phase A Closeout” for the Voyager observability layer in the CAFC Opinion Assistant. The system is already working and golden tests pass; this task is to (1) reduce unnecessary public leakage of internal status and (2) add a one-command operational verification script. Keep changes minimal, additive, and safe.

NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS
1) Do NOT modify any core legal engine logic:
   - doctrine classification
   - Postgres FTS retrieval
   - ranking scorer
   - controlling SCOTUS injection
   - quotable passage extraction
   - context build/pruning
   - LLM prompt strategy
   - citation verification
   - web search fallback ingestion
2) Do NOT change user-facing answer payloads or behavior.
3) Feature flags remain OFF by default.
4) Any observability/audit features must remain best-effort and never block user responses.

GOALS
A) Minimize public exposure of circuit breaker internals (RECOMMENDED HARDENING)
- /api/policy is public and currently includes circuit_breaker with failure_count, last_failure_time, cooldown_remaining.
- Modify /api/policy so it exposes only a minimal, non-sensitive field for circuit breaker, e.g.:
  - "audit_logging_enabled": true/false
  - and optionally "state": "open|closed" ONLY (no counters, timestamps, cooldown)
- Keep full circuit breaker details available only via a protected endpoint requiring X-API-Key matching EXTERNAL_API_KEY:
  - GET /api/voyager/circuit-breaker (protected if it exists; if it is currently public, protect it)
- If EXTERNAL_API_KEY is unset, protected endpoints must fail-closed with HTTP 503.

B) Add a single operational verification command (NOT STRICTLY REQUIRED, BUT HIGHLY USEFUL)
- Create a script: scripts/voyager_verify.sh (or python -m backend.maintenance.voyager_verify)
- It should run, in order:
  1) curl -i /api/policy
  2) curl -i /api/voyager/corpus-version
  3) curl -i /api/voyager/query-runs (expect 401 without key)
  4) if EXTERNAL_API_KEY set: curl -i with key to /api/voyager/circuit-breaker and /api/voyager/retention-stats
  5) python -m backend.golden_tests --mode verify
  6) python -m backend.maintenance.cleanup_query_runs --dry-run --stats
- The script must print clear PASS/FAIL lines and exit non-zero on failure.
- It must not require jq. Use grep/sed only.

C) Update docs/VOYAGER_PRODUCTION.md accordingly
- Document the new public vs protected surface:
  - /api/policy: minimal circuit breaker exposure
  - /api/voyager/circuit-breaker: protected details
- Add instructions for running the new verification script.

DELIVERABLES
1) Brief plan
2) File-by-file diffs
3) How to run: ./scripts/voyager_verify.sh
4) Confirm unchanged core components list
