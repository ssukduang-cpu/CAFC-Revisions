Great — thanks for fixing the P0/P1 issues. Before we proceed to Step 4 (quote-generation/binding_failed prevalence), I need the auditable golden-query artifacts and two sanity checks.

A) Golden Queries — provide the full top-5 tables (required)

For each of the 10 golden queries, paste a table with the top 5 ranked hits including:
	•	rank
	•	case_name
	•	court (SCOTUS/CAFC/PTAB)
	•	precedential_status (en banc / precedential / nonprecedential / n/a)
	•	authority_type (scotus/cafc/ptab/statute/guidance)
	•	explain values:
	•	relevance_score
	•	authority_boost
	•	gravity_factor
	•	recency_factor
	•	framework_boost (if separate; otherwise include in composite or explain explicitly)
	•	application_signal
	•	composite_score
	•	why_this_case (the 1-sentence string shown in UI)

Golden queries:
	1.	§101 Alice/Mayo inventive concept
	2.	Claim construction (Teva/Markman/Phillips)
	3.	§103 obviousness (KSR/Graham)
	4.	Damages/apportionment
	5.	PTAB reviewability (Cuozzo/Thryv/SAS)
	6.	§112 enablement (Amgen/Nautilus + Ariad if used)
	7.	Willfulness/enhanced damages (Halo)
	8.	Injunctions (eBay)
	9.	Fees (Octane)
	10.	DOE/estoppel (Festo/Warner-Jenkinson)

B) Acceptance checks — answer YES/NO per query

For each query, answer:
	1.	Does top-5 include controlling authority (SCOTUS/statute) OR a CAFC precedential hit with holding language + high application_signal?
	2.	Any court/boost inconsistencies in top-20? (must be NO)

C) UI sanity checks (screenshot or component reference)
	1.	Confirm search results view no longer displays citation tier/binding_failed anywhere (it should only show ranking explain/why-this-case).
	2.	Confirm generated answer citations still display tier/score/signals/bindingMethod as before.

D) Implementation references (exact lines)

Provide file + line ranges for:
	•	application_signal computation (show final formula + clamp)
	•	composite_score computation
	•	framework_boost logic
	•	origin normalization mapping

Stop after providing A–D. Once I review those artifacts, I’ll give Step 4 instructions to address quote-generation causes of binding_failed (generator quoting/paraphrase/ellipsis/normalization/OCR).

(Important: do not summarize—paste the full top-5 tables and explain numbers.)
