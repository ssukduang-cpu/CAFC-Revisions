STOP the CAFC wpDataTables scraper approach. We are switching to CourtListener as the source of truth for the full backfill.

Goal: Build a complete manifest of ALL Federal Circuit PRECEDENTIAL OPINIONS from CourtListener, then import and batch-ingest.

1) Replace any CAFC-site scraping scripts with a CourtListener manifest builder.

2) Implement scripts/build_manifest_courtlistener.py that:
   - Calls CourtListener’s RECAP / opinions endpoint(s) to list Federal Circuit opinions (use the official REST API).
   - Filters strictly to:
       court = Federal Circuit (CAFC)
       precedential only
       document type = OPINION (not orders)
   - For each item, output a record with:
       case_name
       appeal_number (if missing, derive from docket_number or leave null)
       release_date (MM/DD/YYYY)
       origin (if available; else null)
       status = "Precedential"
       document_type = "OPINION"
       pdf_url (a direct PDF URL usable for download)
       courtlistener_cluster_id
       courtlistener_url
   - Write output as data/manifest.ndjson (one JSON object per line).
   - Add deterministic deduplication:
       unique key = (courtlistener_cluster_id) OR (appeal_number, pdf_url) if cluster_id missing.
       Ensure NO duplicates are written even if pagination repeats.
   - Log:
       total_rows_fetched
       total_unique_written
       duplicates_skipped

3) Add a FastAPI admin endpoint:
   POST /api/admin/import_manifest
   - Accept either:
       a) NDJSON text body, OR
       b) uploaded file data/manifest.ndjson
   - Insert into SQLite with a UNIQUE constraint using the same dedupe key.
   - Return counts: inserted, skipped_duplicates.

4) Add batch ingestion endpoints (if not already present):
   POST /api/admin/ingest_batch?limit=50
   GET  /api/admin/ingest_status
   - Ingestion downloads PDF, extracts per-page text, and stores pages incrementally (no large in-memory strings).

5) Add a small “smoke test” command:
   - build manifest for limit=100
   - import it
   - ingest 5
   - report status counts (opinions_total, opinions_ingested, pages_total)

Do NOT require Playwright/Selenium. Do NOT scrape cafc.uscourts.gov to discover the full list.
