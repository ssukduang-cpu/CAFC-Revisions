What is the holding of the latest apple case?


The holding of the latest Apple case depends on which specific case you are referring to, as Apple is involved in numerous ongoing legal disputes across various areas of law. Based on the most recent appellate decisions involving Apple, here are summaries of key holdings:

1.
Apple Inc. v. Vidal (2023):
The Federal Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Apple’s challenges to the Director of the USPTO’s instructions regarding institution decisions for inter partes review (IPR). The court held that challenges to the Director’s institution instructions are barred from judicial review under 35 U.S.C. § 314(d), which precludes review of decisions related to whether to institute IPR. The court emphasized that the statutory preclusion of review extends to the substance of the Director’s instructions to the Board. (([1] Apple Inc. v. Gesture Technology Partners, LLC) Apple Inc. v. Vidal), (([2]
 Uniloc USA, Inc. v. Motorola Mobility LLC) Apple Inc. v. Vidal).

2.
Apple Inc. v. Gesture Technology Partners, LLC (2025):
The Federal Circuit addressed Apple’s appeal of a PTAB decision regarding claims of the ’431 patent. The court rejected Apple’s arguments that certain claims were obvious, finding that Apple failed to provide sufficient evidence to meet its burden of proof. The court also held that Gesture forfeited its argument under § 315(e) regarding estoppel because it failed to raise the issue before the Board. (([3]
 Uniloc 2017 LLC v. Apple Inc.) Apple Inc. v. Gesture Technology Partners, LLC), (([4] Omni Medsci, Inc. v. Apple Inc.) Apple Inc. v. Gesture Technology Partners, LLC), (([5]
 Apple Inc. v. Qualcomm Incorporated) Apple Inc. v. Gesture Technology Partners, LLC).

3.
Apple Inc. v. Zipit Wireless, Inc. (2022):
The Federal Circuit reversed the district court’s dismissal of Apple’s declaratory judgment action for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court held that Zipit’s contacts with California, including sending multiple letters accusing Apple of infringement and traveling to Apple’s offices, established sufficient minimum contacts to support specific personal jurisdiction. ([6]
 Apple Inc. v. Zipit Wireless, Inc.), ([7] Apple Inc. v. Zipit Wireless, Inc.).

4.
VirnetX Inc. v. Apple Inc. (2019):
The Federal Circuit held that Apple was estopped under 35 U.S.C. § 317(b) from maintaining parallel PTO reexamination proceedings after a final decision in district court litigation affirmed the validity of the patents at issue. The court rejected Apple’s argument that the validity decision was not final due to unresolved infringement and damages issues. ([8] VIRNETX INC. v. APPLE INC. [OPINION - PRECEDENTIAL]), ([9] VIRNETX INC. v. APPLE INC. [OPINION - PRECEDENTIAL]).
